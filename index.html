            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks 
                and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, 
                so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves 
                meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, 
                but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>

            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, 
                she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some 
                of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, 
                Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human 
                food such as lettuce.</p>
